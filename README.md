## Introduction
**GitHub AutoDeploy** is a PHP script to easily deploy web app repositories on `git push` or 
any other hook. [I][1] wrote this when a relentless search for something which could do this proved 
fruitless. I needed to automatically deploy a web app to a shared server on which I had no SSH 
access, as is required to achieve this. The other way was to setup a git repo on the server and 
execute a `git pull` on each `git push` for the git server, but since it was a shared server, 
there was no `exec` or `shell_exec` for me either.  
So, I had to write it myself. 

## Features
- No SSH access required.
- No shell access required.
- Fully compatible with shared servers.
- Currently, only public repos are supported.

## Setup
1. Download [github-autodeploy.php](github-autodeploy.php).
2. Update the GitHub repo link by replacing `[USERNAME]` and `[REPO]`.
3. Set the deploy directory by replacing `[DEPLOY_DIR]` relative to the script.
4. Set your timezone.
5. Upload the script to your server.
6. On GitHub, [add a WebHook][1] to your repo for a `push` event (or any other) and
set it to the uploaded script.
7. You're done!

Now, whenever you `git push` to your github repo, it will be automatically deployed
to your web server!

## Adding a WebHook
*You must have administrative access to the repo for adding WebHooks*

1. Go to your GitHub repo &raquo; `Settings` &raquo; `Webhooks & services`.  
2. Click `Add webhook`.  
3. Enter the URL of the github-autodeploy.php script in the `Payload URL` field.  
4. Leave everything else as is, click `Add webhook`.  
5. You're done!  

## Contributing
