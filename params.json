[I][1] wrote this when a relentless search for something which could do this proved \r\nfruitless. I needed to automatically deploy a web app to a shared server on which I had no SSH \r\naccess, as is required to achieve this. The other way was to setup a git repo on the server and \r\nexecute a `git pull` on each `git push` for the git server, but since it was a shared server, \r\nthere was no `exec` or `shell_exec` for me either.  \r\nSo, I had to write it myself. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- No SSH access required.\r\n- No shell access required.\r\n- Fully compatible with shared servers.\r\n- Currently, only public repos are supported.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n1. Download [github-autodeploy.php](github-autodeploy.php).\r\n2. Update the GitHub repo link by replacing `[USERNAME]` and `[REPO]`.\r\n3. Set the deploy directory by replacing `[DEPLOY_DIR]` relative to the script.\r\n4. Set your timezone.\r\n5. Upload the script to your server.\r\n6. On GitHub, [add a WebHook][2] to your repo for a `push` event (or any other) and\r\nset it to the uploaded script.\r\n7. You're done!\r\n\r\nNow, whenever you `git push` to your github repo, it will be automatically deployed\r\nto your web server!\r\n\r\n## Adding a WebHook\r\n*You must have administrative access to the repo for adding WebHooks*\r\n\r\n1. Go to your GitHub repo &raquo; `Settings` &raquo; `Webhooks & services`.  \r\n2. Click `Add webhook`.  \r\n3. Enter the URL of the github-autodeploy.php script in the `Payload URL` field.  \r\n4. Leave everything else as is, click `Add webhook`.  \r\n5. You're done!  \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nAll contributions are welcome. Please create an issue first for any feature request\r\nor bug. Then fork the repository, create a branch and make any changes to fix the bug \r\nor add the feature and create a pull request. That's it!\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n**GitHub AutoDeploy** is released under the MIT License.\r\nCheck out the full license [here](LICENSE).\r\n\r\n[1]: https://google.com/+AfaanBilal \"Afaan Bilal\"\r\n[2]: #adding-a-webhook \"Adding a WebHook\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
